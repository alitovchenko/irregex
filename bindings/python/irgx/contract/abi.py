"""Runtime mirror of the contracts this engine is answerable for. The package embeds their load-bearing constants so it has no runtime dependency on a repo file (a wheel ships without them); the package's parity test reads the canonical TOML and asserts this mirror matches it — the standard mirror-plus-parity-test shape, so the two cannot silently drift.

A product's own contract is mirrored in that product's package (`gist._contract`
carries its distribution names and tool boundary), for the same reason its header
is: a mirror can only be gated where the canonical file lives, and a substrate
that mirrored its consumers could not be tested without checking them out.
